# Develop from Zero to Hero Tutorial by EZELAB

See the [website](https://EZEORG.github.io/dev_zero_to_hero/)


## How to contribute

First, you need to learn how to write article with [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/zh/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) or [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) (Markdown is necessary).

After that, you (e.g., WinstonCHEN1) can checkout a new branch using:

```
git checkout -b WinstonCHEN1-add-xxx
```
where, `xxx` is the content of your writing

Then, write a new `xxx.md` in `source/draft` directory.

You should include article infomation for your authorship.

Please check the your profile link and avatar.
